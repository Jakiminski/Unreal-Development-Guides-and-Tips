# Adding Content To A Project

There are many ways for adding existing content to a new project. Any content you import can be found under the *Content* directory. The common methods include:

## Content Packs
* Within the editor, select the **Add New** button from the *content browser*, followed by **Add Feature or Content Pack**.

* Select the pack you would like to include (i.e. Starter Content).

## Marketplace Content
* Marketplace content packs are stored with the *vault* of your epic games launcher *library*.

* Locate the target pack and select the **Add To Project** button, followed by selecting the destination project.
   
## Migrating Content from Existing Projects
* Open the project which contains the content you wish to migrate.

* Select the asset(s) you wish to migrate.

* **Right Click** then hover over **Asset Actions** and select **Migrate**.

* All content relating to the asset(s) will be migrated.

* Within the file browser pop-up, navigate to the destination project and place the migrated files in the *Content* directory.
